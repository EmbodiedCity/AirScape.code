# AirScape: An Aerial Generative World Model with Motion Controllability

In this repository, we present the dataset proposed in the paper, along with the prediction outcomes generated by AirScape.

## Data for Aerial World Model

We present an 11k embodied aerial agent video dataset along with corresponding annotations of motion intention, aligning the inputs and outputs of the aerial world model.
The proposed dataset exhibits diversity across multiple dimensions, including **actions, areas, scenes, and tasks**, as illustrated by the examples below.

⚠️ **Note 1:** The complete dataset exceeds 60GB. Due to anonymity requirements, we cannot provide a direct download link, and this anonymous repository cannot accommodate such a large volume of files. 
Therefore, we provide a selection of examples for demonstration purposes.

⚠️ **Note 2:** Due to the failure of video compilation in the anonymous repository's `README.md`, the videos displayed below are in GIF format. 
These GIFs contain more noise and lower visual quality. For higher-quality versions, please refer to the corresponding videos in the `assets` directory.

⚠️ **Note 3:** GIF files may take some time to load. Please wait for them to display.
